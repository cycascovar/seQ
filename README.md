We provide compiled CSS and JS (`file.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`file.min.*`). Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.



## Branches


  * **Master:** *Production* app
  * **Beta:** *Beta* release 
  * **Dev:** *Develop* Current working.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**
